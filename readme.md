# Delaunay-Triangulation-Cpp

The project consists in implementing the randomized
incremental algorithm for obtaining the Delaunay
Triangulation of a given set of points, in O(nlogn) time.

## Components

The project is composed of three main parts:

- The DAG search structure (a Directed Acyclic Graph);
- A data structure to represent a triangulation;
- The incremental algorithm to get the triangulation.
