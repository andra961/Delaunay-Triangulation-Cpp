# Delaunay-Triangulation-Cpp

The project consists in implementing the randomized
incremental algorithm for obtaining the Delaunay
Triangulation of a given set of points, in O(nlogn) time

## Components

The project is composed of three main parts:

1. The DAG search structure (a Directed Acyclic Graph);
2. A data structure to represent a triangulation;
3. The incremental algorithm to get the triangulation.
